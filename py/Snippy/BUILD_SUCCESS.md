- Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
- This is standard for unsigned executables

### Antivirus
- Some antivirus may flag it (false positive)
- This is common with PyInstaller
- Your code is safe - it's just how PyInstaller packs Python

### File Size
- 250-300 MB is normal
- Cannot be reduced significantly
- Includes entire Python runtime + libraries

## Distribution Tips

### For Users
"Download Snippy.exe and double-click to run. No installation needed!"

### For IT Departments
- Portable executable
- No admin rights needed
- No registry changes
- Runs from anywhere
- Clean uninstall (just delete)

### For Developers
- Source code available in repository
- Built with PyInstaller 6.3.0
- Python 3.10
- Full open source

## Updating

When you make code changes:
1. Edit Python files
2. Run `build_exe.bat`
3. New exe in `dist\Snippy.exe`
4. Replace old version

## Cleanup

### Keep These
- `dist\Snippy.exe` ‚Üê YOUR EXE!
- `Snippy.spec` ‚Üê Build config

### Can Delete
- `build\` folder ‚Üê Temporary files
- `__pycache__\` folders ‚Üê Python cache

## Troubleshooting

### Exe Won't Run
- Install Visual C++ Redistributable
- Run as administrator
- Check antivirus settings

### "Missing DLL" Error
- Download VC++ Redistributable:
  https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

### Slow First Launch
- Normal behavior
- Windows checks the file signature
- Subsequent launches are faster

## Advanced

### Add Custom Icon
1. Get a `.ico` file (256√ó256 recommended)
2. Save as `icon.ico` in Snippy folder
3. Edit `Snippy.spec`:
   ```python
   icon='icon.ico'
   ```
4. Rebuild: `build_exe.bat`

### Reduce Size
Already optimized with:
- `upx=True` (compression)
- Only needed modules
- No debug symbols

Further reduction not recommended.

### Code Signing
For professional distribution:
1. Get code signing certificate
2. Use SignTool.exe to sign
3. Removes security warnings
4. Cost: ~$100-300/year

## Support

### Issues
- Check BUILD_GUIDE.md
- Review error messages
- Test on clean Windows install

### Updates
