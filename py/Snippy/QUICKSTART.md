# Snippy - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 First Time Setup

1. **Open Command Prompt** in the Snippy folder
2. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 📸 Taking a Screenshot

1. Click **"📷 New Capture"**
2. **Click and drag** to select the area you want
3. **Release** - Done! Screenshot saved automatically

**Pro Tip:** The screen freezes when you select, so you see exactly what you're capturing!

## 🎥 Recording Your Screen

### THE NEW WAY (What Makes Snippy Special!)

1. Click **"🎥 Screen Record"**
2. **IMPORTANT:** The screen is LIVE (not frozen)!
   - Set up your windows/apps

3. **Click and drag** to select the area to record
4. **Release** - Recording starts NOW!
5. Do your thing...
6. Click **"⏹️ Stop Recording"** in the overlay (top-right)

### Why This is Better
