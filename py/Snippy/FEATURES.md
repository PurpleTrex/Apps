## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After Updates

### Recording Workflow

**BEFORE (Original):**
```
Click Record → Screen freezes → Can't set up → Bad recording
```

**AFTER (Updated):**
```
Click Record → Live screen → Set up perfectly → Select area → Perfect recording!
```

### Screenshot Capture

**BEFORE:**
```
Select area → Capture from frozen pixmap → Sometimes incorrect coordinates
```

**AFTER:**
```
Select area → Capture directly from screen at release → Always accurate
```

### Selection Overlay

**BEFORE:**
```
Same overlay for all modes
Hard to distinguish purpose
```

**AFTER:**
```
Screenshot: Blue border, frozen screen, dark overlay
Recording: Green border, live screen, light overlay
Clear visual distinction!
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### Screenshot Process
1. User selects mode and clicks capture
2. Main window hides (200ms delay)
3. SelectionWindow appears with frozen screenshot
4. User drags to select area
5. On release: Capture screen at exact coordinates
6. Convert to PIL Image
7. Save as PNG with timestamp
8. Show notification
9. Return to main window

### Recording Process  
1. User clicks "Screen Record"
2. Main window hides (100ms delay)
3. SelectionWindow appears (for_recording=True)
4. Light overlay, no screenshot capture
5. User can see and arrange windows (LIVE!)
6. User drags to select area
7. On release: Emit area coordinates
8. RecorderThread starts with area
9. RecordingOverlay shows in corner
10. User works normally
11. User clicks stop
12. Video finalizes and saves
13. Show notification
