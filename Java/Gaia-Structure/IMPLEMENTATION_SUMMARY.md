# Auto Dependency Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds automated dependency logic and environment management to the Gaia-Structure project creation tool. The system now automatically detects development environments, validates dependency compatibility, and prevents conflicts before project creation.

## New Components

### 1. EnvironmentManager Service
**Location:** `src/main/java/com/structurecreation/service/EnvironmentManager.java`

**Purpose:** Detects and manages information about installed development tools and environments.

**Key Features:**
- Detects installed development tools: Java, Maven, Gradle, Node.js, NPM, Python, Pip, Git
- Caches detection results for performance
- Provides version information for each detected tool
- Identifies required tools for each project type
- Reports missing tools before project creation

**Main Methods:**
```java
// Initialize environment detection (cached)
EnvironmentManager.initializeEnvironments();

// Get information about a specific tool
EnvironmentInfo javaInfo = EnvironmentManager.getEnvironment("Java");

// Check if a tool is available
boolean hasJava = EnvironmentManager.isAvailable("Java");

// Get required tools for project type
List<String> tools = EnvironmentManager.getRequiredToolsForProjectType("Java Maven");

// Get missing tools for project type
List<String> missing = EnvironmentManager.getMissingTools("Spring Boot");

// Clear cache and refresh
EnvironmentManager.clearCache();
```

### 2. Enhanced DependencyPresetService
**Location:** `src/main/java/com/structurecreation/service/DependencyPresetService.java`

**New Features:**
- Version conflict detection
- Dependency compatibility checking
- Known incompatibility detection (e.g., Django vs Flask)
- Version compatibility validation

**New Methods:**
```java
// Check for version conflicts
List<String> conflicts = DependencyPresetService.checkVersionConflicts(dependencies);

// Get all dependency conflicts
List<String> allConflicts = DependencyPresetService.getDependencyConflicts(dependencies);

// Check if a version is compatible
boolean compatible = DependencyPresetService.isVersionCompatible(projectType, depName, version);
```

### 3. Enhanced MainController
**Location:** `src/main/java/com/structurecreation/controller/MainController.java`

**Enhancements:**
- Initializes environment detection on startup (background thread)
- Validates environment before project creation
- Shows warnings for missing tools
- Detects and warns about dependency conflicts
- New menu item: Tools → Environment Information

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Users are warned if required development tools are missing
- Users can proceed with warnings or cancel to install tools
- Dependency conflicts are detected and reported before creation
- Environment information dialog shows all detected tools and their status

### 4. UI Enhancements
**Location:** `src/main/resources/fxml/main.fxml`

**Changes:**
- Added new "Tools" menu between "File" and "Help"
- Added "Environment Information" menu item (Ctrl+E shortcut)

## User Workflows

### Environment Information Workflow
1. User selects Tools → Environment Information (or presses Ctrl+E)
2. System displays detected environments with:
   - Tool name and version (green checkmark if available)
   - Red X if tool is not detected
   - Required tools for currently selected project type
   - Warning if required tools are missing
3. User can refresh environment detection
4. Dialog helps users identify what needs to be installed

### Project Creation with Validation
1. User configures project settings
2. User clicks "Create Project"
3. System validates:
   - Basic input (name, location, etc.)
   - Required development tools for project type
   - Dependency version conflicts
   - Known incompatibilities between dependencies
4. If issues found:
   - User sees confirmation dialog with details
   - User can proceed anyway or cancel to fix issues
5. Project is created with full knowledge of potential issues

## Test Coverage

### EnvironmentManagerTest
**Location:** `src/test/java/com/structurecreation/service/EnvironmentManagerTest.java`

**Tests:**
- Environment initialization
- Tool detection
- Availability checking
- Required tools identification
- Missing tools detection
- Cache management
- EnvironmentInfo data class

**Coverage:** 9 tests, all passing

### DependencyPresetServiceTest
**Location:** `src/test/java/com/structurecreation/service/DependencyPresetServiceTest.java`

**Tests:**
- Preset retrieval
- Compatibility checking
- Version conflict detection
- Version compatibility validation
- Dependency conflict detection
- Project type compatibility
- Recommended version retrieval
- DependencyPreset data class

**Coverage:** 8 tests, all passing

## Technical Details

### Environment Detection Algorithm
1. Attempts to execute each tool with version flag
2. Captures stdout and stderr
3. Parses version information from output
4. Caches results to avoid repeated executions
5. Handles missing tools gracefully

### Compatibility Checking
1. **Type Compatibility:** Ensures all dependencies use same package manager
2. **Version Conflicts:** Detects multiple versions of same dependency
3. **Known Incompatibilities:** Hardcoded rules for known conflicts
4. **Project Type Matching:** Validates dependency type matches project build tool

### Performance Optimizations
- Environment detection runs in background thread on startup
- Results are cached for the session
- Cache can be manually refreshed
- Detection is lazy-loaded on first access

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system works out of the box by:
1. Detecting standard tool locations on PATH
2. Checking environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME)
3. Executing standard version commands

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Custom tool detection rules
2. Download links for missing tools
3. Automatic tool installation
4. More sophisticated version compatibility rules
5. Integration with package manager APIs for real-time version checking
6. Dependency resolution suggestions
7. Vulnerability scanning integration

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing functionality preserved
- New features are opt-in (warnings can be dismissed)
- No changes to file formats or APIs
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Documentation Updates

Updated README.md with:
- Environment detection features
- Dependency compatibility features
- New Tools menu
- Troubleshooting for missing tools
- What's New section

## Build and Deployment

- Project builds successfully with Maven
- All tests pass (17 tests total)
- JAR file generated: 13MB (includes JavaFX)
- Compatible with Java 17+
- No additional dependencies required

## Summary
