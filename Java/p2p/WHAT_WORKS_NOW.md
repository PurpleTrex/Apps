- JSON message protocol implementation  
- Background service for peer discovery
- File transfer capabilities
- Push notifications
```

**iOS App Requirements:**
```
- TCP server listening on port 8080/5000
- JSON message protocol implementation
- Network service management
- File transfer capabilities  
- Background processing
```

### 🔗 **Popular Messaging Platform Integration**
To connect with existing messaging apps, would need:

**WhatsApp Integration:**
- WhatsApp Business API implementation
- Message bridging service
- API credentials and setup

**Telegram Integration:**  
- Telegram Bot API implementation
- Bot token and webhook setup
- Message format conversion
